 Debugging HTML & CSS using Inline, Internal, and External Styles
 Problem Statement
We were provided with an HTML file using three different types of CSS:

Inline CSS

Internal CSS

External CSS

However, the original file had several errors in CSS syntax and style application. The goal was to debug and apply the correct styles so that all three CSS methods work as expected.

Fixes & Explanation
 1. Internal CSS Fixes
Issue:
Invalid background-color value:

css
Copy
Edit
background-color: #f0f0;
Fix:
Updated to a valid 6-digit hex:

css
Copy
Edit
background-color: #f0f0f0;
Reason:
The value #f0f0 is not a valid 3-digit or 6-digit hex color. The correct version is #f0f0f0.

 2. Inline CSS Fixes
Issue:
Inline style had invalid hex code:

html
Copy
Edit
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3333;">
Fix:
Corrected to:

html
Copy
Edit
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #333;">
Reason:
#3333 is not a valid hex color. Valid shorthand is #333.

 3. External CSS Fixes
Issue:
The styles.css file was not created or referenced correctly.

Fix:

Created styles.css

Added this CSS:

css
Copy
Edit
#main-container {
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
Linked it in the HTML:

html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Reason:
To ensure the <div id="main-container"> applies external styles properly as required.
